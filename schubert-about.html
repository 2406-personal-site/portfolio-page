        In addition to my professional interests, I do these other things in my
        copious spare time.

      <h2 class="about-h2">Schubertiaden</h2>
      <p>
        My friends Vogl and Mayrhofer throw parties for me where my music<br />
        is played for friends and socialites. Vogl and Mayrhofer love my works,
        <br />
        and they are convinced that anyone who hears them will be equally
        charmed.<br />
        The parties are called <i>Schubertiaden</i> after me, the guest of
        honor.
      </p>

      <h2 class="about-h2">Reading Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        Other musicians get together to play and critique one another's works.
        <br />
        At these sessions, we learn a lot from the give-and-take with
        colleagues,<br />
        even though we would be mortified to admit we changed anything.

      <h2 class="about-h2">Cyclothymia Society</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to my dipsomania, I live every day with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothymia">Cyclothymia</a>.
        <br />
        It can make me cranky, and that makes it harder to schmooze<br />
        the socialites who come to Vogl and Mayrhofer's <i>Schubertiaden</i>.
        <br />
        But I am not my diagnosis, and I hope the research we support <br />
        will spare future sufferers from my fate.
