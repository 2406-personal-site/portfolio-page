      <p>
        You know how you start home projects and then never finish them? <br />
        Take it from me: don't put these things off.<br />
        You never know how much time you might have left. <br />
      </p>

      <h2 class="about-h1">Project 2: Symphony in b minor</h2>
      <p>
        This project is something I never got around to finishing. <br />
        It's not like I just died in the middle of it -- <br />
        it appears I must have lost interest. <br />
        In any case, the work is complete as it stands, <br />
        with just the two finished movements.<br />
      </p>

      <h2 class="about-h1">Project 3: Symphony No. 10</h2>
      <p>
        My latest project was interrupted by my untimely departure. <br />As
        great as my "Great" C Major Symphony was, <br />imagine how much greater
        a Tenth Symphony might have been.<br />
